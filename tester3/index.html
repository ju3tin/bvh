        <canvas width=640 height=480></canvas>
        <h2>Destroy black objects. Avoid blue ones. Try to get the longest chain.</h2>

        <p>Wave bright orange-colored objects on screen, and try to hit black squares, while avoiding blue ones. The longer one goes without missing, the faster it gets. The portions detected as orange are highlighted in red. The color detection is fairly rudimentary, and lighting dependent (I had too keep adjusting it as the day progressed), so your success may vary.</p>
